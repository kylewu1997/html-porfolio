<p>Curious MarTech analyst shifting deeper into tech, slowly rebuilding from “beginner” basics in HTML, networking, and Braze while refusing to fake understanding—always asking for the simplest, clearest explanation. </p>

<p>A reflective, slightly self-critical learner who journals, shoots unplanned city photos on a Samsung S25 Ultra, and uses that wandering, observant mindset to notice details in code, campaigns, and everyday moments..</p>
